If you are installing on **WINDOWS** please open the command promt as **Administrator** and run ``` npm install -g windows-build-tools ```    
Wait for it to install.    
Then Shift + Right click in the folder and select "Open Powershell window here" and run ``` npm install ```     
**INSTALLATION TIMES WILL VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION AND COMPUTER PERFORMANCE**    

5. Change the file "config-README.json" to "config.json" and enter your bot token, your user ID and your desired prefix for the bot with a text editor. (preferably Notepad++ However normal text editors should still work).   
If you do not see the ".json" at the end of the file name ignore using them in the file name, that will make the bot unable to find the config file
6. Start the bot with 
```
node index.js
```
