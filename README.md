## How to Setup
1. Install [Nodejs v14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install git or just download the repository as a zip file:
```
git clone https://github.com/NightCrafter1/Discord-Utilities
```
3. Extract the ZIP file.
4. Install Dependencies:    
If you are installing on **WINDOWS** please download [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16#)    
Open the file, the installer will start downloading. Once finished, a window titled "Visual Studio Installer" should appear. Under the workloads tab Make sure to select **Desktop development with C++** and then click install. ![image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3RgX.png)
Wait for it to install.    
Once installed, in the same window run ``` npm config set msvs_version 2017 ```    
Then Shift + Right click in the folder and select "Open Powershell window here" and run ``` npm install ```     
**INSTALLATION TIMES WILL VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION AND COMPUTER PERFORMANCE**    

5. Change the file "config-README.json" to "config.json" and enter your bot token, your user ID and your desired prefix for the bot with a text editor. (preferably Notepad++ However normal text editors should still work).   
If you do not see the ".json" at the end of the file name ignore using them in the file name, that will make the bot unable to find the config file
6. Start the bot with 
```
node index.js
```
